        Hi, my name is Joseph
        \n\nI am a student at College of Southern Nevada
        \n\nI have been studying programming for two years now
        \n\nThis summer I had an internship at Allegiant Air
        \n\nI learned a lot from my time there and I was very grateful for the opportunity to learn with real professionals
        \n\nI will graduate this Winter. When I graduate I plan to attend Western Governors University for my bachelor\'s degree
        \n\nI really enjoy programming and I can\'t say how happy I am that I decided to become a programmer
        \n\nMy plan is to become a software engineer once I get my Bachelors, but I\'ll be happy to get any programming job
        \n\n
